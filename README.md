An AI-powered toolkit for the **financial domain**, providing extensible features for data-driven decision support.  

---
## 🚀 Features
- 📰 **Sentiment Analysis on Articles**  
  - Classify financial news & reports into **Positive / Neutral / Negative** sentiments using **BERT** fine-tuned on domain-specific data.  
  - Useful for traders, analysts, and portfolio managers to detect market mood.  

** News category classfication on Articles headers and summary**
- Classifiy financial news into categories (Business & Finance, Politics, Travel,...)
- Dataset: [Huffpost](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset/data) 210k news headlines from 2012 and 2022 from HuffPost. Each record in dataset consists of attributes: category, headline, authors, link, short_description, date.
- Experiments and results:
| Method | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| GRU | --- | --- | --- |
| LSTM | --- | --- | --- |
| BiLSTM | 0.6385 | 0.6232 | 0.6385 |

Furthermore, I also using FastAPI to get response prediction of news headlines.
